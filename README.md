The goals of this project should be to introduce shader knowledge over time from basic concepts to advanced ideas with examples and explanations along the way. Please consider contributing if you have shader knowledge. Fix the examples if there are performance problems, contribute your own numbered examples.

You can right click on shaders and compile them with compile_shader.editor_script to test them and improve performance. This script requires Arm Mobile Studio to be installed. Download and install Arm Mobile Studio from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/graphics-and-gaming/mali-offline-compiler/downloads/

TODO make this project compile with GitHub actions and upload updated HTML5 project to GitHub pages.
