This project is heavily inspired by https://wgld.org/ the goals of this project should be similar. To introduce shader knowledge over time from basic concepts to advanced ideas with examples and explanations along the way. Please consider contributing if you have shader knowledge. Fix the examples if there are performance problems, contribute your own numbered examples.

You can right click on shaders and compile them with compile_shader.editor_script to test them and improve performance. This script requires Arm Mobile Studio to be installed. Download and install Arm Mobile Studio from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/graphics-and-gaming/mali-offline-compiler/downloads/
